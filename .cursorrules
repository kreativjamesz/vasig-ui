# Cursor Rules for Vasig UI

## NPM Publishing
- **ALWAYS require OTP (One-Time Password) when publishing to NPM**
- Use `npm publish --otp=<otp-code>` or ensure 2FA is enabled
- Never publish without OTP verification
- Always verify the package version before publishing

## Code Style
- Use Taglish when communicating with the user
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency with Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 setup

## Component Development
- All components should support dark mode
- Use the `cn()` utility for class merging
- Follow the existing component structure (Component.vue + types.ts)
- Export components and types in src/index.ts

## CLI Development
- Interactive prompts should use inquirer
- Support both interactive mode and command-line flags
- Always save configuration to vasig.json
- Provide helpful error messages and next steps

## Component Synchronization
- **CRITICAL: Any changes made to components in `src/components/` MUST also be applied to `cli/templates/`**
- When updating a component (Component.vue or types.ts), update the corresponding template in `cli/templates/`
- CLI templates should match the source components exactly (except import paths use `@/utils/cn` instead of `@/utils/cn`)
- After updating templates, rebuild the CLI: `cd cli && npm run build`
- This ensures users installing via CLI get the same components as the library version
